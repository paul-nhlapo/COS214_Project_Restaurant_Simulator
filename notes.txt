Basically, UI is the context, it will have a place Order function, 
that place order function will call the tables accept(Waiter*) function, 
which in turn calls the Walter's visit function, which just gets the tables order vector.

Staff is the visitor, waiter is the concrete visitor. I think we need to be creating Waiters as
we create the floor, then when a customer is created, the table is assigned an existing waiter
